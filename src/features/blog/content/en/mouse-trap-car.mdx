## Mouse Trap Car

For this school project I challenged myself with compound levers, allowing for much more string to be pulled from the same mouse trap.  
It worked up until the competition, where it did not perform as expected.

## The Goal

The main goal was to travel 5 meters as fast as possible.  
There was also another side goal — to travel as far as possible.  
I chose to try and make a mousetrap car travel as far as possible.

## Concept

The first ideas of the project using compound levers.

## Slight Issue

With most of the weight on one side, the wheels had uneven grip.  
This made the car turn slightly as it moved.  
This was never fixed and we just rotated the car at the starting line.

## Final

The only thing added at this stage were some more decorations.
