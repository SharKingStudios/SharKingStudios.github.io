## Horizon Driving – Buckle Up for High-Speed Action

Welcome to **Horizon Driving** — my masterpiece ✨. This is an adrenaline-pumping, fast-paced **arcade driving game** where you take the wheel and dive into intense chases. Evade traffic, outmaneuver cops, and unleash your driving skills on a road where speed is your only ally.  

With **multiple cars**, **smooth animations**, and an addictive loop of high-speed fun, this is the dream game I’ve wanted to make for a long time.

## Game Demo

Here’s a preview of the gameplay in action. Watch as the player drifts through traffic, dodges cops, and activates nitro boosts to break free!

## Awesome Features

- **Stylish Animations** — Enjoy dynamic menus and transitions powered by LOVE2D.  
- **Skill-Based Gameplay** — Easy to start, tough to master, and super rewarding.  

## How to Play

The controls are simple but the challenge is real:

- Arrow Keys: Move your car  
- **A**: Activate Nitro  
- **Green Bar (bottom left):** Health

Your goal? Stay alive, go fast, and avoid collisions for as long as possible.
