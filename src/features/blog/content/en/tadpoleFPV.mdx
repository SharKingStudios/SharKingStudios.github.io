# Tadpole FPV Transmitter PCB

This project started as a small FPV drone idea, but most of the completed work ended up being focused on designing a **custom, cost-effective FPV transmitter PCB**.

---

## Transmitter Concept and Part Selection

I also worked to figure out how I could control the drone with a custom transmitter PCB.  
I found that the flight controller I selected would work with ExpressLRS, which is an open source radio link protocol that would work with an ESP32 based transmitter. By pairing the ESP32 with an appropriate LoRa module I found, I should be able to create a custom transmitter PCB that can control the drone.

(The Transmitter Electronics list is still a work in progress)

Finding good parts on AliExpress was more tedious then I expected as the prices seemed to keep changing, but I think I have a good completed list for the transmitter that should work well together.

## Finalizing Transmitter Electronics

I had to take a massive break from this project due to a surgery I had, but now that I'm back I can continue working on the drone.

I figured out the final parts I would need for the transmitter electronics and found suitable parts on AliExpress.  
Once again, finding such parts with the specifics I was looking for was more time consuming than I was hoping for.

I wanted to keep the device charging as easy as possible so I am using USB-C for the power input and 18650 battery charging.

I also created a mockup of the transmitter electronics that I will be designing in KiCAD.

## Starting the PCB Design in KiCAD

With the parts selected, all I needed to do was add them into KiCAD...  
Little did I know this would be the hardest part of the session.

Finding all of the correct schematics and footprints for the parts was what I spent a good few hours on.  
Eventually I had gotten the schematics and footprints imported correctly into KiCAD as shown by these glorious screenshots:

]} />

After getting these key components in, I wired up the schematic starting with the power section.

After getting the power section wired up, I moved on to the LoRa module and ESP32 transmitter section.

The last thing I worked on for the day was a custom footprint for the TP5100 battery charger as well as removing the keepout zone from the LoRa ESP32 module. (As it would not need to use Wifi or Bluetooth)

## Finishing the Transmitter Schematic

I finished up the input side of the controller by adding pins to interface with the gimbals and switches.

I also went through and added a footprint for each of the components in the schematic that didnt already have one.

## Power Section Issues and Redesign

While looking over the schematic, I realized that I had made a mistake in the power section.  
Due to some interesting advertising, I had thought that the TP5100 battery charger could handle 2S batteries, but it turns out that is not the case.

I elected to switch my batteries into a parallel configuration instead of series, which would allow me to use the TP5100 charger.  
This meant I had to change my buck converter since the new nominal voltage would be 3.7V instead of 7.4V. (The buck converter I had selected needed at least 6V to operate)

Soon I was down the rabbit hole of finding a new buck converter that would be able to work with the new voltage.

During this process, I found the WEBENCH Power Designer by Texas Instruments, which I used to create a buck boost converter schematic that would work with the new voltage.

I also found some components on LCSC for the schematic.

## PCB Layout and Routing

I started the day knowing I wanted to make the PCB as absolutely small as possible, and portrait.  
The size would be largely constrained by the battery holders on the back of the PCB.

Placing components got interesting as the batteries prevented me from adding tht components in that area.  
This meant that a majority of the components would get pushed to the extremes of the board.

]} />

With all the components in place, I started wiring the traces of the board.  
This process was made harder by my incessent love of thicker traces, and close component positions.

>*Now this is my kind of puzzle*

I used .4mm traces for a majority of the board leading to this quite *mesmerising* power section routing:

After a good while with some music in the background, I reached this:

## PCB Art

I spent the day working on the PCB art and getting it ready for fabrication.  
Here's the latest renders of the board:
