## BOM
All the bits and pieces needed can be found **[here](https://github.com/SharKingStudios/SplashPad/blob/main/BOM.md)**.

---

## What is this?  
It’s a **custom macropad** built with the **Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040**, **KMK firmware**, and **way too many LEDs**. Whether you’re gaming, editing, coding, or just pressing random buttons for fun, this thing’s got you covered.

### Features:
- **3x3 Matrix** – Nine glorious keys to map to whatever your heart desires.
- **Rotary Encoder** – Twist for volume, scroll, or secret hacker functions.
- **Clickable Encoder Button** – Because sometimes, twisting isn’t enough.
- **14 SK6812 Mini LEDs** – Way too many for a macropad this size. But hey, ✨blinkenlights✨.
- **Multiple LED Modes** – Solid, Rainbow, Wave, and Grid Fade, for when you need that cyberpunk aesthetic.
- **KMK Firmware** – Python-powered and open-source, because we like freedom.

---

## How It Works:
This macropad runs either **KMK** or **QMK**, which means you get:
- **Custom Keymaps** – Map macros, media keys, or even full-blown scripts.
- **Dynamic Layers** – More functions per button? Yes, please.
- **LED Control** – Pulsing blue? Rainbow waves? Subtle grid fade? Pick your poison.
- **Rotary Encoder Support** – Spin for volume, brightness, scrolling, or **whatever**.

---

## How to Use:  
1. **Flash KMK** onto your XIAO RP2040. *(If you don’t know how, Google it.)*<br />*or flash my QMK build* from [here](https://github.com/SharKingStudios/SplashPad/tree/main/Firmware/QMK).
2. **Drop `kb.py` and `main.py`** onto your board.<br />*or use the QMK firmware provided in the link above.*
3. **Plug it in.** Watch the lights do their thing.
4. **Press buttons.** Turn the knob. Make magic happen.

---

## LED Modes:
Because a macropad without RGB is just a fancy calculator.

- **Solid Mode** – A slow, pulsing blue (totally not just lazy coding).
- **Rainbow Mode** – Taste the colors.
- **Wave Mode** – Water flow effect because vibes.
- **Grid Fade Mode** – Simulates sunlight through water. Or something poetic like that.

*(Press the encoder button to switch between them.)*

## Why?
I built this macropad for [Hackpad](https://hackpad.hackclub.com/)—an awesome Hack Club YSWS project run by [Alex Ren](https://github.com/qcoral). With a the funding provided by the project, I wanted to create something that’s as practical as it is playful. Whether you're coding, gaming, or just jamming to your favorite tunes, this macropad is my way of saying:

#### why settle for ordinary when you can hack something extraordinary?
##
## The Biggest Challenge:
I wanted to use nice thick wires for my PCB (0.6mm) and routing all of these took quite a bit of effort. I think the time spent was definitely worth it, as the routing looks *awesome*.

---

## The Final Build:
After soldering everything together and putting it in the case, here’s how it looks:

(The super cool keycaps are from [Undercity](/blog/en/highway-to-undercity/)!)

---

## Future Plans (Maybe):  
- [OLED Screen?](https://github.com/SharKingStudios/Riptide) 🤔
- Bluetooth support? (If I hate myself enough to deal with that.)
- More layers? (How many is too many? Asking for a friend.)
- [MIDI support](https://github.com/SharKingStudios/Fracture)? (Why not turn this into a DJ controller?)

## Disclaimer  
This project is 100% free, [open-source](https://github.com/SharKingStudios/SplashPad/), and powered by **vibes**. If it breaks, explodes, or opens a black hole, **that’s on you.**
