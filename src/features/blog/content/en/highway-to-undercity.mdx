## Highway to Undercity: Reviewing + Staffing

This summer I served on Undercity staff (Hack Club’s 4-day hardware hackathon at GitHub HQ, San Francisco) and as a project reviewer for **Highway** (the grant program that feeds into Undercity).
I personally reviewed 200+ individual projects — everything from custom PCBs and weird controllers to custom 3D printers.

Between Highway grants and Undercity’s 72-hour build sprint, teens shipped dozens of wild hardware projects!

## Quick facts

- **Highway (grants):** Up to $350 per project for teen hardware builds; earn points by shipping projects  
- **Undercity (finale):** **July 11–14, 2025 @ GitHub HQ (SF)** — teens from **19 countries**, **166 makers**, **75** projects demoed  
- **My roles:** Highway Project Reviewer (200+ projects) • Undercity Staff (check-in, operations, support)

## What I did

- **Project reviews (200+):** Evaluated submissions for build clarity, feasibility, BOM, safety, and learning goals; left actionable feedback to help with iteration
- **Staffing at Undercity:** Check-in, tool lending, lab safety, mentor soldering, late-night debugging and demo coaching  
- **Make my own Project:** Created my own Highway project, a fully custom (infinitely expandable) *mechanical keyboard* with hand-wired RGB lights and a 3D-printed case

## About Highway & Undercity

**Highway** is Hack Club’s summer hardware program — ship projects, get funded, and collect points. **Undercity** is the invite-only,
in-person 4-day finale at GitHub HQ where teams build and demo hardware in 72 hours (food + tools provided, sleep at HQ).
