## Makerspace 5 - Concrete Project

For this school project the goal was to create concrete that could withstand someone jumping onto it.  
Both versions of concrete that I created held up very nicely.

## First Prototype

When this batch set, it was not very pretty.  
I got a good bit of concrete stuck on the top rim of the PVC I was using.

When this batch came out it was looking very smooth indeed.  
I love the way this turned out.

## Final Prototype

I had some problems with this batch, and it came out more rough and dusty than the batch earlier.

## Final

Both batches held up perfectly well against people standing on them.
