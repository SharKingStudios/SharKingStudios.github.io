## Daydream Atlanta: Running the show

I was the lead organizer for **Daydream Atlanta**, a teen-led, free 2-day game jam at Georgia Tech as part of Hack Club’s worldwide Daydream weekend.
Across Sept 27-28, 2025, nearly 90 students teamed up, attended workshops, and built playable games they shipped to itch.io.

## About Daydream (global)

Daydream is Hack Club’s worldwide teen-run game jam — 100+ cities, thousands of teen hackers, and a weekend of workshops, hacking, and demos.
After the weekend, Hack Club ran Daydream Global, a two-week online jam (Sept 29–Oct 12, 2025) so teams could keep building and submit to a global showcase.

## How I learned Godot: *Yeastbound: Rise of the Dough*

As part of prepping for Daydream, I built and released a small Godot game. It placed **15th overall** out of ~**190** entries in **Daydream Global**, and **Hack Club highlighted it as #2 in Audio** across submissions.

- Play it on itch: https://sharkingstudios.itch.io/yeastbound-rise-of-the-dough
